The knight finds out that Demons that die in the dungeon is returned to life. 
Demons on their death return as ghosts. 
The knight will fight demons, giants, chorts, ogres, and zombies.
The knight comes across information that the boss of the monsters is the one bringing them back to life. 
The boss was using the gold coins that he had collected from the ogres to trade for new or renewed life for his horde of minions.
The player wins by progressing through the dungeon by defeating the minions and the boss of the dungeon. 
The challenge lies in defeating all the monsters in the room as some or all of them come back to life.
The player interacts with the game world by moving throughout the rooms, defeating or being defeated by the enemies presented to the player.
